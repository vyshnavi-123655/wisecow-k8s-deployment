# Wisecow Application - Containerization and Deployment on Kubernetes

## Overview

This project involves the containerization and deployment of the **Wisecow application** on a **Kubernetes environment** with **secure TLS communication**. The application is automatically built, pushed to a container registry, and deployed using a **CI/CD pipeline** powered by GitHub Actions.

---

## Features

- **Dockerization**: The Wisecow application is containerized using Docker.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: The application is deployed and exposed as a service in Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD**: Automated continuous integration and deployment of the application using GitHub Actions.
- **TLS Implementation**: Ensures secure communication using TLS for the Wisecow application.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Docker**: To build and run containers locally.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: A Kubernetes environment for deployment (e.g., Minikube for local, or a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, etc.).
- **GitHub Account**: For accessing the repository and enabling GitHub Actions.
- **Container Registry**: A registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) to push the Docker image.

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyrahul/wisecow.git
cd wisecow

Step 2: Build the Docker Image
In the project directory, build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
docker build -t wisecow-app .
Step 3: Run the Docker Container Locally (optional)
You can test the application locally by running the container:
docker run -p 8080:8080 wisecow-app
Step 4: Kubernetes Deployment
Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running, and your kubectl is configured to interact with it.

Apply the Kubernetes manifest files located in the k8s/ directory to deploy the application:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f k8s/
Verify the deployment:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
The Wisecow application should now be exposed as a Kubernetes service.

CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions to automate the build, push, and deployment processes.

GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow is located in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml.
Build & Push: The workflow is triggered whenever changes are pushed to the repository. It builds the Docker image and pushes it to a container registry (Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).
Deployment: After the image is successfully pushed, the workflow automatically deploys the updated container to the Kubernetes environment.
TLS Implementation
Securing the Application with TLS
To ensure secure communication with the Wisecow application, we implement TLS/SSL certificates.

Create TLS certificates: Generate or obtain a valid TLS certificate and key for your domain.

Store TLS certificates in Kubernetes: Create a Kubernetes secret to store the certificate and key securely:

bash
Copy code
kubectl create secret tls wisecow-tls --cert=path/to/cert.crt --key=path/to/cert.key
Update Kubernetes Deployment: Modify the Kubernetes deployment files to mount the secret and configure the application to use TLS.

The application will now be accessible over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

Kubernetes Service Not Exposed: Ensure your service manifest has the correct type (e.g., LoadBalancer or NodePort) for external access.
TLS Certificate Issues: Verify that the certificate and key are correctly mounted as Kubernetes secrets and that the application is properly configured to use them.
CI/CD Fails: Check the GitHub Actions logs for errors. Common issues include incorrect permissions for pushing Docker images or issues with Kubernetes deployment configurations.
